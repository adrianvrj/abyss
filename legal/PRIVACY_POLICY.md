# Privacy Policy for Abyss

**Last Updated: October 22, 2025**

---

## Introduction

Welcome to Abyss ("we," "us," "our," or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices. This Privacy Policy explains how Abyss handles information when you use our blockchain-powered slot machine game.

**The Short Version: We only collect your wallet address and game data for blockchain functionality. No personal information is collected.**

---

## Information We Collect

Abyss collects minimal information necessary for game functionality:

### Wallet Information
- ✅ **Wallet address** (your public blockchain address)
- ✅ **Game session data** (scores, levels, spins, game outcomes)
- ✅ **Leaderboard data** (rankings, total scores)

**How we use this:**
- To record your game sessions on the blockchain
- To update and display the global leaderboard
- To track your progress and levels
- To enable competitive gameplay

**Important:** Your wallet address is public on the blockchain and cannot be linked to your personal identity unless you choose to share that connection.

---

## Information We DO NOT Collect

We **DO NOT** collect:

- ❌ Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)
- ❌ Device identifiers (IMEI, MAC address, advertising IDs)
- ❌ Location data (GPS, IP address-based location)
- ❌ Usage analytics or behavioral tracking
- ❌ Crash reports or diagnostic data
- ❌ Contact lists or photos
- ❌ Payment information or financial data
- ❌ Browsing history or activity outside the app
- ❌ Any information that identifies you personally

## How the App Works

### Local Wallet Creation

When you first launch Abyss:

1. **A blockchain wallet is generated locally on your device**
   - The wallet creation happens entirely on your phone/tablet
   - Your private keys are generated and stored only on your device
   - We never see, access, or store your private keys
   - You have complete control and ownership of your wallet

2. **Local Storage Only**
   - Game settings (like haptics preferences) are stored locally on your device
   - Terms of Service acceptance is stored locally
   - All data stays on your device using standard iOS/Android secure storage

### Blockchain Technology

Abyss uses blockchain technology for game state management:

- **Blockchain Network:** Starknet
- **What goes on the blockchain:**
  - Game session data (session ID, scores, levels, spins remaining)
  - Game outcomes (pattern matches, final scores)
  - Leaderboard rankings

- **What does NOT go on the blockchain:**
  - Your name or personal information
  - Your device information
  - Any way to identify you personally

**Important:** Blockchain transactions are public by nature of blockchain technology. However, these transactions only contain your wallet address and game data - no personal identifying information.

## Your Wallet and Private Keys

### Complete Control

- Your wallet is **yours and yours alone**
- Your private keys never leave your device
- We cannot access your wallet
- We cannot recover your wallet if you lose your device
- You can export your private key from Settings (with security warnings)

### Security Recommendations

1. **Backup your private key** - Export it from Settings and store it securely
2. **Never share your private key** - Anyone with your private key has full access to your wallet
3. **Keep your device secure** - Use device lock and security features
4. **Don't take screenshots** - Of your private key or sensitive wallet information
