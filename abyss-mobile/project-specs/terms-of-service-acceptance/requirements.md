# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Terms of Service (ToS) acceptance flow for a blockchain-based entertainment application. The application creates a user wallet for gaming purposes with no real monetary value at stake. The ToS serves to clarify the entertainment-only nature of the application, establish usage guidelines, and protect both users and the application provider from liability.

The ToS acceptance must be presented to first-time users before they can access the application's main features. This creates a clear legal framework while ensuring users understand the recreational nature of the platform. The implementation must be non-intrusive yet ensure users have the opportunity to read and understand the terms before accepting.

Since no personal user data is collected or managed (beyond the locally-created wallet), the ToS will focus on usage terms, disclaimers about the entertainment nature of the games, liability limitations, and basic rules of conduct.

## Requirements

6. WHEN the user declines the ToS THEN the system SHALL display a message explaining that acceptance is required to use the app
7. IF the user declines the ToS THEN the system SHALL provide an option to close the app or review the terms again

### Requirement 4: Acceptance Persistence
**User Story:** As a returning user who has accepted the ToS, I want to access the app directly without seeing the terms again, so that I have a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accepts the ToS THEN the system SHALL store the acceptance state in local persistent storage
2. WHEN the acceptance state is stored THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp of when the acceptance occurred
3. WHEN a user opens the app on subsequent launches THEN the system SHALL check the local storage for existing ToS acceptance
4. IF the ToS acceptance is found in storage THEN the system SHALL bypass the ToS screen
5. WHILE the app is in use THE system SHALL maintain the acceptance state across app restarts

### Requirement 5: ToS Version Management
**User Story:** As an app maintainer, I want to be able to update the ToS and require users to accept new versions, so that I can adapt to legal or business requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the ToS content is stored in the application THEN the system SHALL include a version number or identifier
2. WHEN the stored acceptance state is checked THEN the system SHALL compare the accepted version with the current version
3. IF the current ToS version differs from the accepted version THEN the system SHALL display the ToS screen again
4. WHEN a new version of the ToS is presented THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that the terms have been updated
5. WHEN the user accepts updated ToS THEN the system SHALL update the stored acceptance state with the new version and timestamp

### Requirement 6: Readability and Accessibility
**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to read the entire ToS comfortably before making a decision, so that I can make an informed choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. IF the ToS text is lengthy THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth scrolling performance

### Requirement 7: Edge Cases and Error Handling
**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle unexpected situations gracefully, so that I'm not blocked from using the app due to technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. IF the ToS content fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide a retry option
2. IF the storage of acceptance state fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prevent progression to the main app
3. WHEN checking for existing acceptance state IF the storage is corrupted THEN the system SHALL treat the user as not having accepted and display the ToS
4. IF the user attempts to navigate away from the ToS screen (e.g., background the app) before accepting THEN the system SHALL return to the ToS screen when the app is reopened
5. WHEN the app is backgrounded during ToS acceptance THEN the system SHALL maintain the current state (scroll position, etc.) when returning to the foreground
